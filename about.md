I'm Rob aka rehr. I'm an electrical engineer specializing in rapid prototyping at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com). I enjoy dissecting children's toys, cooking up new pizza recipes (ever tried black beans on pizza?), and exercising outdoors. This is only the tip of the iceberg, so hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mediumrehr) or [email](mailto:heyrob@hackth.is) if you're curious for more, or if you want to collaborate.
