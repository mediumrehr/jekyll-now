Hello, neighbor! I'm Rob, or Rehr, you choose. I'm an electrical engineer specializing in rapid prototyping at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com). I enjoy deconstructing children's toys, cooking up new pizza recipes (ever tried black beans on pizza?), and running until it stops hurting. This is only the tip of the iceberg, so hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mediumrehr) or [email](mailto:heyrob@hackth.is) if you want to learn more.
